SPEAKER: With the different types of ML models in your mind, let's apply concept to practice.
00:05
In this lesson, you explore BigQuery ML and walk through the steps to build an ML model with SQL commands.
00:13
You learned about BigQuery, the primary data analytics tool on Google Cloud, from the previous lesson.
00:19
BigQuery provides two services in one.
00:22
It's a fully managed storage facility to load and store data sets and a fast, SQL-based analytical Engine.
00:30
The two services are connected by Google's high-speed, internal network.
00:34
It's this super-fast network that allows BigQuery to scale both storage and compute independently, based on demand.
00:43
Although BigQuery started out solely as a data warehouse, over time, it has evolved to provide features that
00:49
support the data-to-AI lifecycle, meaning you can perform both data analytics and build predefined ML models within BigQuery.
00:58
In this lesson, you explore BigQuery's capabilities to build ML models and walk through the steps and key SQL commands to do so.
01:06
If you've worked with ML models before, you know that building and training them can be very time-intensive.
01:12
You must first import and prepare the data.
01:15
Then, experiment with different ML models and tune the parameters.
01:19
To improve model performance, you also need to go back and forth to train the model with new data and features.
01:26
And finally, you need to deploy the model to make predictions.
01:29
This is an iterative process that requires a lot of time and resources.
01:34
Now, with BigQuery ML, you can manage tabular data and execute ML models in one place with just a few steps.
01:42
BigQuery ML tunes the parameters for you and helps you manage the ML workflow.
01:48
Let's walk through the phases of a machine learning project and the key SQL commands.
01:53
In phase 1, you extract, transform, and load data into BigQuery if it isn't there already.
02:00
If you're already using other Google products, like YouTube, for example, look out for easy connectors to get that data into BigQuery before you build your own pipeline.
02:10
You can enrich your existing data warehouse with other data sources by using SQL joins.
02:15
In phase 2, you select and preprocess features.
02:19
You can use SQL to create the training data set for the model to learn from.
02:24
BigQuery ML does some of the preprocessing for you, like one-hot encoding of your categorical variables.
02:31
One-hot encoding converts your categorical data into numeric data that is required by a training model.
02:37
In phase 3, you create the model inside BigQuery.
02:41
This is done by using the CREATE MODEL command.
02:44
In this example, you want to create an ML model to predict customer purchasing behavior, specifically if they will buy this product in the future.
02:53
You give the model a name, ecommerce.classification.
02:57
You then specify the model type.
02:59
Remember the previous lesson about ML model types?
03:03
If you want to predict whether a customer will buy or not, which ML model should you use?
03:10
That's right.
03:11
A logistic regression model is the answer because you are solving a classification problem.
03:18
Apart from the logistic regression model to solve the classification problem, BigQuery ML also supports other popular ML models.
03:26
They include regression models, such as linear regression, and other models, such as k-means clustering and time series forecasting models.
03:35
In addition to providing different types of machine learning models, BigQuery ML supports MLOps, Machine Learning Operations.
03:43
MLOps turns your ML experiment to production and helps deploy, monitor, and manage the ML models.
03:50
You'll learn more about MLOps later in this course.
03:54
You're recommended to start with simple options, such as logistic regression and linear regression, and use the results as a benchmark to
04:01
compare against more complex models, such as DNN, Deep Neural Networks, which take more time, and computing resources to train and deploy.
04:10
After specifying the model type, you also need to define the label column.
04:15
Why?
04:16
Remember the two major categories of ML models, supervised and unsupervised?
04:22
The former deals with labeled data and predicts a goal, whereas, the latter handles unlabeled data and identifies a hidden pattern.
04:29
Is this a supervised or unsupervised model?
04:33
Of course, it's a supervised classification problem.
04:37
Thus, a labeled column.
04:39
From there, you can run the query.
04:41
In phase 4, after your model is trained, you can execute an ML.EVALUATE query to evaluate the performance of the trained model on your evaluation data set.
04:54
It's here that you specify which evaluation metrics the model will assess, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
05:03
You'll explore these metrics later in this course.
05:06
Finally, in phase 5, when you're happy with your model performance, you can then use it to make predictions.
05:13
To do so, invoke the ML.PREDICT command on your newly trained model to return with predictions and the model's confidence in those predictions.
05:24
With the results, your label field will have "predicted" added to the field name.
05:30
This is your model's prediction for that label.
05:33
Ready for hands-on practice?
05:35
Let's apply these steps and build your first ML model in BigQuery.
05:40
In the upcoming lab, you'll use real e-commerce data from the Google Merchandise Store to predict whether a visitor will make future purchases.
05:51
You'll gain valuable experience creating data sets, training and evaluating ML models, and using them for predictions.
06:00
Don't worry if SQL isn't your strong suit.
06:03
Gemini Code Assist will be your 24/7 tutor, helping you explain, create, and debug code throughout the lab.
06:12
Let's get started.
