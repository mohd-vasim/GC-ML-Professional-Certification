SPEAKER: Before you dive in to more practical topics and build your own machine learning model, let's prepare you with foundational knowledge and explore the AI model categories.
00:11
First, let's pause to clarify two terms, artificial intelligence and machine learning.
00:17
You may note that people often use the terms interchangeably, but they do have some differences.
00:22
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is an umbrella term that includes anything related to computers mimicking human intelligence.
00:30
Some examples of AI applications include robots and self-driving cars.
00:35
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.
00:43
This is in contrast to traditional programming, where the computer is told explicitly what to do.
00:49
Machine learning mainly includes supervised and unsupervised learning.
00:53
You might also hear the terms deep learning or deep neural networks.
00:57
This is a subset of machine learning that adds layers in between input data and output results to make a machine learn at much depth.
01:05
You'll learn more about neural networks and deep learning later in the course.
01:09
Finally, generative AI, or GenAI, creates content and performs tasks based on requests.
01:16
GenAI uses foundation models like large language models, a type of deep learning model, to predict, interpret, and interact with language.
01:27
You'll delve deeper into GenAI models in the next module.
01:31
So what's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
01:36
Imagine two types of problems.
01:38
In problem one, you are asked to classify dogs and cats from a very large set of pictures.
01:44
You already know the difference between dogs and cats, so you label each picture and pass the labeled pictures to a machine.
01:51
By learning from the data, in this case, pictures with the answers or labels, supervised learning is being
01:57
enacted, allowing the machine to tell if a new picture represents a dog or cat in the future.
02:03
In problem two, you are asked to classify breeds of dogs.
02:07
Unfortunately, this time, you don't know many of them and are not able to label the pictures.
02:12
So you send these unlabeled pictures to a machine.
02:16
In this case, the machine learns from the data without the answers and finds underlying patterns to group the animals.
02:22
This is an example of unsupervised learning.
02:26
Put simply, supervised learning deals with labeled data, is task-driven, and identifies a goal.
02:32
Unsupervised learning, however, deals with unlabeled data, is data-driven, and identifies a pattern.
02:39
An easy way to distinguish between the two is that supervised learning provides each data point with a label or an answer, while unsupervised learning does not.
02:48
There are two major types of supervised learning.
02:51
The first is classification, which predicts a categorical variable, such as determining whether a picture shows a cat or a dog.
02:59
In ML, you use models like a logistic regression model to solve classification problems.
03:05
The second type of supervised learning is regression, which predicts a numeric variable like forecasting sales for a product based on its past sales.
03:13
You use ML models like a linear regression model to solve regression problems.
03:18
There are three major types of unsupervised learning.
03:21
The first is clustering, which groups together data points with similar characteristics and assigns them to clusters, like using customer demographics to determine customer segmentation.
03:32
You use ML models like k-means clustering to solve clustering problems.
03:38
The second type is association, which identifies underlying relationships like a correlation between two products to place them closer together in a grocery store for a promotion.
03:48
You use association rule techniques and algorithms like Apriori to solve association problems.
03:55
And the third type of unsupervised learning is dimensionality reduction, which reduces the number of dimensions or features in a data set to improve the efficiency
04:03
of a model, for example, combining customer characteristics like age, driving violation history, or car type, to create a simplified rule for calculating an insurance quote.
04:15
You use ML techniques like principal component analysis to solve these problems.
04:21
All right.
04:21
Time to test your learning.
04:23
You are asked to predict customer spending based on purchase history.
04:27
Is this supervised or unsupervised learning?
04:32
Yes, that's supervised learning because you have the labeled data, the amount the customers have spent, and you want to predict their future purchases.
04:40
Is this a classification or regression problem?
04:44
Yes, it's a regression problem because it predicts a continuous number, future spending.
04:50
Which ML model should you use?
04:52
A logistic regression or a linear regression?
04:56
Yes, a linear regression.
04:58
A logistic regression model is for classification problems, while a linear regression model is for regression problems.
05:05
Let's look at another scenario.
05:07
Imagine you were using the same data set.
05:10
However, this time you were asked to identify customer segmentation.
05:14
You don't want to base your judgment on stereotypes such as age or gender.
05:19
So you use a computer for help.
05:21
Is this supervised or unsupervised learning?
05:25
Yes, it's unsupervised learning because you don't have each customer labeled as belonging to a certain segment.
05:32
Instead, you want the computer to discover the underlying pattern.
05:36
Is it a clustering, association or dimensionality reduction problem?
05:42
Yes, identifying customer segmentation is a clustering problem.
05:46
Which ML model should you use?
05:49
A logistic regression?
05:50
A linear regression?
05:51
Or a k-means clustering analysis?
05:55
Right, it's a clustering analysis scenario.
05:58
You will find these models within BigQuery ML, AutoML and Custom Training later on in this course.
