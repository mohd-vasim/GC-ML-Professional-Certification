SPEAKER: Building on the previous lesson where you explored Google's three-layered AI architecture, including AI infrastructure,
00:06
AI development, and AI applications and solutions, you'll now delve into the foundational layer, AI infrastructure.
00:15
Since its inception in 1998, Google has been dedicated to data and AI.
00:21
A decade later, in 2008, Google Cloud was introduced to offer secure and flexible cloud computing and storage solutions.
00:30
You can think of the AI infrastructure in terms of three layers.
00:35
At the base layer is networking and security, which lays the foundation to support all of Google's infrastructure and applications.
00:43
On the next layer, sit compute and storage.
00:46
Google Cloud separates, or decouples, as it's technically called, compute and storage, so they can scale independently based on need.
00:55
The top layer includes data and AI products, which enable you to perform tasks to ingest, store, process, and deliver business insights, data pipelines and ML models.
01:09
Thanks to Google Cloud technology, these tasks can be accomplished without needing to manage and scale the underlying infrastructure.
01:17
However, understanding some essentials about Google Cloud compute and storage can help you grasp the higher level data and AI products.
01:25
Let's begin with compute.
01:27
Organizations with growing data needs often require lots of compute power to run data and AI jobs.
01:34
And as organizations design for the future, the need for compute power only grows.
01:40
Google offers a range of computing services, from flexible infrastructure to fully managed serverless platforms, balancing control and convenience.
01:49
For example, Compute Engine-- high control, like managing a physical server; Google Kubernetes Engine, GKE-- control over containerized apps with orchestration benefits; Cloud Run-- serverless convenience.
02:05
Google manages infrastructure.
02:07
You might be familiar with the container platform GKE and serverless options like Cloud Run.
02:12
For more details, check out Google Documentation in the reading list.
02:17
Where does the processing power come from?
02:20
It's from the hardware, computer chips.
02:23
However, traditional computer chips like Central Processing Units, or CPUs, and even the more recent Graphics
02:28
Processing Units, or GPUs, may no longer scale to adequately reach the rapid demand for AI.
02:36
To help overcome this challenge, in 2016, Google introduced the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU.
02:44
TPUs are Google's customized application-specific chips to accelerate AI workloads.
02:51
TPUs act as domain-specific hardware, as opposed to general-purpose hardware like CPUs and GPUs.
02:58
This allows for higher efficiency by tailoring the architecture to meet the computation needs in a domain, such as the matrix multiplication in machine learning.
03:09
Cloud TPUs, faster and more energy efficient than GPUs and CPUs for AI ML, are integrated across Google products, offering state-of-the-art supercomputing technology to Google Cloud customers.
03:23
Let's now examine storage.
03:25
For proper scaling capabilities, compute and storage are decoupled.
03:30
That is one major difference between Cloud and desktop computing.
03:33
With cloud computing, compute and storage can scale separately.
03:38
Most applications need a database and storage solution of some kind.
03:43
Your best option depends on your data type and business needs.
03:48
For unstructured data like documents, images, and audio files, cloud storage is your ideal choice.
03:56
Alternatively, if your data is structured, organized in tables, rows, and columns, you have options like BigQuery, AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, and others.
04:09
Note that BigQuery, Google's flagship data warehouse, is particularly versatile.
04:15
It's built for structured data and also highly optimized for semi-structured data like JSON.
04:22
It can even query unstructured data, such as log files or images stored in cloud storage, by creating an external table that provides a structured reference to that data.
04:35
This leads to the top layer of the Google Cloud infrastructure, data and AI products.
04:41
As you explored earlier, Google Cloud offers a comprehensive suite of data and AI tools.
04:46
How do you piece them together?
04:48
To build a data-to-AI project, you orchestrate these products through a data-to-AI workflow-- ingest and process, store and analyze, and activate with AI.
05:00
First, ingest and process data from diverse sources, both real-time and batch, using tools like Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Dataproc, and Cloud Data Fusion.
05:11
Next, store your data in solutions like Cloud Storage.
05:15
Then analyze it with various tools.
05:17
Use BigQuery, AlloyDB, Cloud SQL, and Spanner for SQL databases.
05:25
Use Bigtable and Firestore for NoSQL databases.
05:29
Use Looker for visualization.
05:32
Finally, activate your insights with AI.
05:35
Train predictive models for forecasting, or leverage Gen AI for content creation and action.
05:41
Vertex AI is the central AI development platform, offering products like Vertex AI Studio, Agent Builder, AutoML, and notebooks for AI projects ranging from out-of-the-box solutions to custom builds.
05:55
These tools are seamlessly integrated on Google Cloud, enabling data scientists and AI developers to efficiently transition from data to AI.
06:05
For example, BigQuery offers embedded SQL commands to train an ML model, a feature you'll explore later.
06:11
Additionally, within a Vertex AI notebook, you can easily pull data directly from BigQuery using SQL for advanced model training.
06:21
Don't let the variety of options overwhelm you.
06:23
You'll focus on BigQuery, the primary data warehouse, and Vertex AI, the AI development platform, later in this course.
06:31
But before that, let's get you ready with another fundamental topic, AI models, in the next lesson.
